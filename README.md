htaccess = Hypertext Access - Tests

What is htaccess ?

An .htaccess file is a directory-level configuration file supported by several web servers, used for configuration of website-access issues, such as URL redirection, URL shortening, access control, and more. The 'dot' before the file name makes it a hidden file in Unix-based environments.
